# Password typing device

> HID capable USB device

I created this as a workaround for typing in my annoyingly long password.
it is just an Arduino pro micro modified to have a USB A connector instead of the mini USB connector that it comes with.

I added a switch and button to add extra functionality

In the `.ino` file you can see i soldered the switch to pin 3

You can program this to type anything, use it like a USB Rubber Ducky, etc.
